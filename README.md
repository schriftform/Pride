# Our Pride is open source

Last year, we open-sourced our [Pride flag design](https://github.com/microsoft/Pride-flag) representing 40 LGBTQIA+ communities. Our latest update reflects almost 50 identities and comes with new layouts. Plus, we are open-sourcing the entire Pride design and invite you to remix, share and make more Pride.
